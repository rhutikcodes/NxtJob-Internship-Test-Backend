1. How do you stay updated on backend development topics and remain active in the community? (Forums/Discord/Slack/Meetups/Twitter/Blogs)
->
I actively follow a few channels to stay current:

Forums/Communities: I regularly visit forums like Stack Overflow and Reddit’s r/webdev and r/node for discussions. There’s always something new popping up.

Discord/Slack: I’ve joined a few Discord channels, like Nodeiflux,devsnet and indian tech devs (for Node.js devs) and devsnet on Slack. Great places to talk about frameworks and new tools in real time.

Meetups: I occasionally attend local tech meetups where edtech and developers come and share ideas (like the ones on instagram.com live meets) or online events like Hacktoberfest. Networking with others at these events helps me learn directly from the community.

Blogs/Newsletters: I subscribe to newsletters like JavaScript Weekly and Smashing Magazine. Also, following blogs like The Practical Dev helps me stay on top of trending technologies.

Twitter/X: I follow backend-focused developers and companies (like Vercel, AWS, or Node.js maintainers) who share new updates and ideas.

2. What are your most-used IDE and keyboard shortcuts when coding?
->
IDE: I primarily use VS Code for all my coding work. It’s flexible, has great extensions for linting, and plays well with Node.js and other backend tools.

Keyboard Shortcuts:

Ctrl + P (or Cmd + P on Mac) to quickly jump to files.
Ctrl + Shift + L to select multiple occurrences of a word.
Ctrl + / for quickly commenting/uncommenting lines.
Alt + Shift + Down/Up to duplicate lines of code.
F2 to rename variables or functions across the entire project.
Ctrl + Shift + B to build the project quickly.
Approaching Scalable Backend System Design:

3. How do you approach the design and implementation of a scalable backend system? Feel free to attach code snippets for better explanation.
->
When designing a scalable backend system, I break it down into a few steps:

Step 1: Understand the Requirements: First, I make sure to understand the volume of traffic, data, and functionality. I work out the architecture based on these needs, whether it's a monolithic app, microservices, or serverless.

Step 2: Database Design: I aim for efficient data models, normalized for relational databases or optimized for NoSQL. If I expect heavy traffic, I’ll consider adding a caching layer with Redis or Memcached.

Step 3: API Design: I prioritize RESTful principles but lean towards GraphQL when flexibility is needed. Here’s a simple example of a REST endpoint in Express.js
