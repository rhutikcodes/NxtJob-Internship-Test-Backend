1. How do you stay updated on backend development topics and remain active in the community? (Forums/Discord/Slack/Meetups/Twitter/Blogs)
To stay updated on backend development topics, 
    1. Fourms and Communities:
        1. Stack Overflow: Great for finding solutions to specific problems, contributing, and seeing what challenges others face.
        2. Dev.to: A community of developers where I can find articles, discussions, and tutorials.
    2. Discord:
        1. Backend Development Discord Channels: Devcord, CodeSupport are the dedicated backend discord servers to discuss more topics about the backend development.
    3. Meetup:
        1. Meetup.com: I always active in meetup.com to find best meetup spots near by my location.
    4. Blogs and Newsletters:
        1. Sign up for weekly newsletters like Node Weekly, Backend Weekly, or Dev Digest.

2. What are your most-used IDE and keyboard shortcuts when coding?
Most used and favourite IDE is VS Code.
    1. ctrl + p : Quick file search, great for quickly navigating files in large projects.
    2. ctrl + shift + f : Global search across files.
    3. crtl + / : For commenting and uncommenting.
    4. crtl + shift + k : Delete an entire line.
    5. F2 : Rename file or folder.
    6. alt + click : Create multiple cursors, letting you type in multiple places simultaneously.
    7. ctrl + c : To copy.
    8. ctrl + p : To paste.

3. How do you approach the design and implementation of a scalable backend system? Feel free to attach code snippets for better explanation.
    1. Architectural Decisions:
        I usually start by choosing an architecture that suits the applicationâ€™s growth potential. For instance, I prefer microservices for large, evolving systems because they allow independent scaling of services, whereas a monolithic architecture can be effective for simpler systems. I also incorporate load balancing to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers for high availability.
    2. Asynchronous Processing:
        For handling large loads efficiently, I incorporate message brokers like RabbitMQ or Kafka to offload tasks to background services, ensuring the system remains responsive.

    3. Caching & Performance Optimization:
        I integrate caching strategies using tools like Redis to minimize database hits and reduce response times, improving performance significantly.
