1. How do you stay updated on backend development topics and remain active in the community? (Forums/Discord/Slack/Meetups/Twitter/Blogs)
->There are few ways that i use to stay updated on any topics that are related to my tech stack and till now most helpfull way is that i have
  joind few groups(community) on facebook that has many members with same interest in technology, where we share info with each other to stay 
  updated on what's new in the market. and there are other ways also like youtube, twitter(X), stackoverflow, even i use instagram to get to know
  new things about technology.

2. What are your most-used IDE and keyboard shortcuts when coding?
-> Ctrl + P,  Ctrl + D, Ctrl + Shift + L, Alt + Click, Ctrl + Click, Ctrl + Shift + P, Ctrl + /, Ctrl + B


3. How do you approach the design and implementation of a scalable backend system? Feel free to attach code snippets for better explanation.
->first i will try to understand the problem or the requirements, then i will go with what things to work with, like technologies for example
 database like MongoDB, PostgreSql, runtime environment like i use Node.js, for framework i have used Express.js, then i focus on how my backend 
 will be divided i use MVC(model, view , controller) where there will be separate folder for routes, for models, Logic(controller), so if these are
 independent to eachother in terms of updating or making any changes then we can easily scale these components. also we can use caching like i have used redis 
 to reduce the load from database.
