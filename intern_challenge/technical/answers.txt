1.  Explain, in your own words, the importance of data consistency in real-time applications.
->Let’s take Collab-Doc-Editor, the collaborative document editor I built, as an example. Imagine 
you and your team are editing the same document in real time. Every change—whether it’s text edits or 
formatting—is instantly reflected across all users without anyone needing to refresh the page.

This real-time data consistency ensures that no one's work is overwritten, and every update appears 
seamlessly for all collaborators. If two people edit simultaneously, both changes are merged without conflict,
keeping the document accurate and in sync for everyone. This is the core importance of data consistency in real-time
applications like CollabDoc—it ensures smooth, collaborative editing without delays or errors

2. How do you handle concurrency issues in a multi-user environment?
->In the collaborative document editor project, we can handle concurrency 
by using optimistic locking, which allows multiple users to edit the same document 
at the same time. We can ensured that updates from different users were sent in real-time, 
and any conflicts (like two users editing the same line) were detected early. To manage this,
I'll prioritized changes based on the order they were received, and if conflicts occurred, 
the app would notify users and suggest merging edits.

3. Describe a scenario where you had to optimize database queries for better performance.
->In my social media app project, I encountered performance issues related to slow database queries, 
especially when retrieving frequently accessed data such as user profiles, posts, and comments. 
To address this, I implemented Redis as a caching layer to optimize database query performance. And to reduce the load from main database.

4. Discuss the trade-offs between using WebSockets and HTTP/2 for real-time communication.
->When deciding between WebSockets and HTTP/2 for real-time communication, it depends on the use case. 
WebSockets are great for continuous, low-latency updates like in a chat app or a collaborative tool, 
where you need a constant flow of data. They maintain a persistent connection but can be trickier to 
scale. On the other hand, HTTP/2 enhances efficiency with features like multiplexing, making it better 
for handling lots of simultaneous requests, but it’s not ideal for constant real-time updates. So, for 
continuous, real-time data, WebSockets win, while HTTP/2 shines in optimizing multiple requests.
