1. How do you stay updated on backend development topics and remain active in the community? (Forums/Discord/Slack/Meetups/Twitter/Blogs)
    -> I frequently make new projects of a kind that I never made before and learn new concepts from it. For example I recently worked on a chatting application where I learnt about the concepts of websockets. I majorly use Stackoverflow whenever I get stuck and I also read blogs.

2. What are your most-used IDE and keyboard shortcuts when coding?
    -> I use VS code. The various keyboard shortcuts that I use frequently are:
        1. ctrl + D     -> That lets us update same word in different locations.
        2. alt + click  -> to create multiple key bind.
        3. ctrl + B     -> to open and close primary side bar.
        4. ctrl + N     -> create new file.
        5. ctrl+shift+N -> open new window.
        6. ctrl + F     -> to find occurences of a word in a file.
        7. ctrl+shift+F -> to find and replace multiple occurecnes of a word in various files.
        8. ctrl + s     -> save (Most frequently used shortcut when autosave is turned off).
        9. ctrl + c     -> copy
        9. ctrl + v     -> paste

3. How do you approach the design and implementation of a scalable backend system? Feel free to attach code snippets for better explanation.
    -> For Designing Part:
        1. We have to make load estimation.
        2. We have to decide the scalabity goal.
        3. We have to decide on performance goal.
    -> For implementation part:
        1. Implementation of microservices which requires us to make small service that can be scaled seperately.
        2. Load balancing to evenly distribute the API call across various services.
        3. Implementation of Caching to reduce load on database.
