1. How do you stay updated on backend development topics and remain active in the community? (Forums/Discord/Slack/Meetups/Twitter/Blogs)
-> To stay updated on backend development I -
   have made one particular youtube channel where I just see coding or coding industry related things. So whatever happens in the industry I get notified about those

   I join relevant discord and slack groups which are made specifically for backend.

   I do follow some well knowleged influencers on social media to get updates.
   
   I subscribe  to newsletters like "Hacker news".


2. What are your most-used IDE and keyboard shortcuts when coding?
-> My most used IDE is Visual Studio Code due to its extensive exosytem of extension, easy to use.

   ctrl + D : select the next occurence of the current word.
   ctrl + Z : To undo the last changes
   F2 : Rename symbol
   ctrl + shift + C: Copy terminal output.

3. How do you approach the design and implementation of a scalable backend system? Feel free to attach code snippets for better explanation.
-> So it is a very crucial feature to use this in implementation.

   We can horizontly scale our database by creating more server and storing data to different databases

   or vertical scaling can be done adding more RAM and storage to the cpu.

   Asynchronous Processing 
    
   caching and load balancing
