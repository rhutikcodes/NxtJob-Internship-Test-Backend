3. How do you approach the design and implementation of a scalable backend system? Feel free to attach code snippets for better explanation.
->To design and implement a scalable backend system, I follow these steps

Understand Needs: Determine how many users or how much data the system will handle.

Choose Setup:
Microservices: Break the system into small, separate parts that can work independently.
Stateless: Make sure the system doesnâ€™t remember past requests.

Optimize Database:
Sharding: Split data into different databases for better management.
Indexing: Use indexes to speed up searches.

Distribute Traffic:
Load Balancing: Use a tool to spread incoming requests across multiple servers.

Speed Up Access:
Caching: Use Redis to store frequently accessed data quickly.

Handle Background Tasks:
Message Queues: Use RabbitMQ to manage tasks that run in the background.

Monitor and Scale:
Track Performance: Watch how the system performs and adjust resources as needed.
