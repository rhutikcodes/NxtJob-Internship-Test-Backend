To stay updated on backend topics,It takes continuous learning. Stack Overflow is a great place to learn new things.When i get stuck in code, I usually reach out to stackoverflow .I get to learn many things eventually solving the issue.I also attend online workshops.I signed up with news letters which send regular posts via email.I subscribed to many youtubers who post regular videos about trending technologies. These are the ways I use to stay updated with backend development related topics.
