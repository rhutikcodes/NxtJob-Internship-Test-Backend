2. What are your most-used IDE and keyboard shortcuts when coding?
->For coding, I most commonly use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) due to its versatility, extensibility, and robust support for modern development workflows.
  Shortcuts that I use most are crl+c and ctrl+v (just kidding) other shortcuts that I use :
  Ctrl + /: Toggle comments on and off for the selected lines.
  Ctrl + Shift + F: Search across all files in the project.
  Alt + Shift + F: Format the current file.
  Ctrl + `: Open or close the integrated terminal.
